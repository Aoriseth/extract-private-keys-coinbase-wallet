## How to extract private keys
1. Get your private keys from the Coinbase Wallet app
2. Download another wallet which also uses 12-word backup phrases (I used Exodus wallet, seems to work for me)
3. Perform a restore in the other wallet app with the 12-word backup from Coinbase Wallet
4. Go to the crypto you want to get the private keys for and use the settings/menu to export/view the private keys
